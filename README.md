# IIIF Samples with Mirador Viewer

In this repository I'm creating samples of IIIF A/V manifest (Presentation API v3). [Mirador](https://projectmirador.org/) (version 3) is implemented as the viewer. 
The manifests here are written according to the [Document of IIIF AV Working Groupe](https://github.com/IIIF/iiif-av/blob/master/source/api/av/index.md), especially the part ["A/V Description in the Presentation API"](https://github.com/IIIF/iiif-av/blob/master/source/api/av/index.md#av-description-in-the-presentation-api).


## Samples 
You can see the samples with Mirador:
[https://nbtkmy.github.io/iiif_av_test/testviewer_Mirador.html](https://nbtkmy.github.io/iiif_av_test/testviewer_Mirador.html)

5 sample manifests are created. You'll see the first manifest (One viedeo on one canvas), if you open the Mirador viewer. 
There are 4 more manifests in the collection page in the viewer. 

## Comments & results (2020-11-24)
### Mirador
Mirador can render one video object on one canvas. So Mirador renders one video or one video fragment. 
The video fragment is rendered successfully at the first time, but when you replay it, the viewer shows the video in the full length. 
If you put more objects (2 videos in parallel or in a time sequence, or one video plus a caption line) on a canvas, the viewer recognizes only one object as item...
